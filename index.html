Key things you will learn include</p><ul><li>What is culture, Change Management and how it impacts security</li><li>Two difference Change Management models and how to apply them to security</li><li>Most common mistakes organizations make</li><li>Learn why emotion often trumps numbers / statistics, and how to leverage that to your advantage.</li></ul></td></tr>

<td>Special Webcast: Effective Threat Hunting</td>
<td>Speakers: Chris Dale<p>Prevention is not everything, and without detection, we're sitting ducks. In this talk, Chris Dale will present on the concept of Threat Hunting and introduce good and effective threat hunting techniques for your security teams. How can we detect the bad guys, even the more notorious and advanced threats; with the goal to kick them out before they can secure their objectives? There will always be a way for a threat actor to find a way inside your network, whether it be criminals after monetization, Advanced Persistent Threats or inside threats. What are effective ways of finding them before damage is done?</p></td></tr>

<td>Speakers: Hannah Coakley<p>The biggest challenge that security analytics addresses is the volume and diversity of information that can be analyzed at a given point to assist security professionals in detecting, responding to and mitigating cyber threats. But how do you leverage that data to implement security best practices?</p><p>InsightIDR is a single solution that provides visibility across your traditional on-premise environment, but also extends monitoring to your remote endpoints and cloud services. Join us to learn how InsightIDR provides visibility into your network and highlight useful metrics to implement security best practices.</p><p>In this webcast, we will discuss:</p><ul><li>How to make security analytics more consumable</li><li>The data sources you need to collect and analyze</li><li>How InsightIDR leverages pre-built analytics to detect top attack vectors</li></ul></td></tr>

<td>Special Webcast: Simplify Your Office 365 Migration</td>
<td>Speakers: Sibrina Subedar and Brandon Helms <p>By migrating to Microsoft Office 365, organizations gain robust, cloud-based reliability and enhanced security. However, even with 0365s security model, most enterprises are leaving the front door open. Lack of extended email security such as DMARC enforcement is allowing phishing and BEC attacks to grow exponentially - $7.5B in losses in just the last 18 months according to FBI reports.</p><p>But it's not just about security: In the cloud era, you need to know which services are in use and are authorized to send an email and which are not as well as which are compatible with Office 365 prior to your migration.</p><p>During this webinar, we will help you get your cloud house in order:</p><ul><li>Learn more about how to secure your O365 deployment against phishing attacks while increasing deliverability and trust using domain-based authentication.</li><li>Get tools to identify and mitigate shadow IT email services.</li><li>Learn how to automate your domain lockdown without investing a lot of time and resources.</li></ul></td></tr>
